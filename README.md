# CaDence: Real-Time Data Analytics for Music Streaming Platforms
CaDence is a real-time data analytics platform designed to help music streaming companies gain deep insights into user behavior, optimize recommendations, and predict emerging music trends. It processes user event data to provide actionable insights for improving user experience and making data-driven decisions.

# Overview
CaDence leverages a combination of data engineering, cloud-based analytics, and real-time data processing to provide music streaming platforms with insights into user engagement, trends, and behaviors. It helps companies optimize content, enhance marketing strategies, and boost user engagement by transforming raw data into valuable insights.

# Problem Statement & Purpose
Music platforms generate massive amounts of user data every second, including listening habits, device types, subscription levels, and more. This raw data is not useful on its own. Music platforms need a way to process, analyze, and visualize this data to improve user experiences and make data-driven decisions. CaDence solves this problem by providing a scalable and efficient ETL pipeline that turns complex data into actionable insights.

# How It Works
CaDence follows an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process streaming data:

Extract: User event data is collected in JSON format, generated by EventSim.

Transform: Data is cleaned and transformed using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) in Google Colab.

Load: Cleaned data is visualized through a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard, providing real-time insights.
The dashboard allows users to filter data by week or timezone and analyze trends such as top artists, session durations, and user demographics.

# Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Google Colab: Interactive development and data experimentation.
Matplotlib, Plotly: Data visualization and trend analysis.
Streamlit: Web-based interactive dashboard for real-time insights.
EventSim: Simulated event data generation for testing at scale.
Apache Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform used to handle real-time data ingestion, ensuring high throughput and fault tolerance.
Apache Spark: Distributed data processing engine for real-time analytics, enabling the processing of large-scale streaming data with low latency.

# Key Features & Insights
CaDence provides an intuitive, interactive dashboard with real-time insights:

Subscription & Device Analytics: Visualizes the breakdown of free vs. paid users and the most popular devices.
Demographic Insights: Displays a heatmap for user distribution and gender-based analytics.
Trend Prediction: Ranks top songs, visualizes listening duration, and highlights trending artists through a word cloud.
Filtering Capabilities: Allows users to filter insights based on timezone and week for more targeted analysis.
These features empower music platforms to personalize recommendations, identify emerging trends, and optimize content for better engagement.
